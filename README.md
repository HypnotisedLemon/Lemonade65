# Lemonade65
A 65% keyboard with both top and oring mount.
Oring mount posts are same as Bakeneko65 by Kkatano.
There is absolutely no thought behind top mount points except for them being directly above oring mount posts because I reallly liked how it flet along with some additional mounting points to experiment a bit (equidistant 4 points for top side while close-top-the edge point on bottom edge for experimenting with spacebar sound and feel).
