# Lemonade65
1. A 65% keyboard with both top and oring mount and internal weight (or sheet should I say?).<br />
2. Oring mount posts are same as Bakeneko65 by Kkatano.<br />
3. There is absolutely no thought behind top mount points except for them being directly above oring mount posts because I reallly liked how it flet along with some additional mounting points to experiment a bit (equidistant 4 points for top side while close-top-the edge point on bottom edge for experimenting with spacebar sound and feel).<br />
