# Lemonade65
1. A 65% keyboard with both top and oring mount and internal weight (or sheet should I say?). <br />
Some basic features being internal wight (or sheet should I say), unified C3 daughterboard based with 6 degree typing angle. <br />
2. Oring mount posts are same as Bakeneko65 by Kkatano. <br />
3. There is absolutely no thought behind top mount points except for them being directly above oring mount posts because I really liked the sound and feel of the oring mount post positioning. <br />
4. There are some additional mounting points to play around a bit with feel and sound a bit more. These addiotional top mount positions include 2 points on top edge so that all the mounting points at the top are equidustant while closer-to-the-edge points on bottom edge for experimenting with spacebar sound and feel. <br />
